### Computation Description for `single_round_ridge_regression`

#### Overview
The `single_round_ridge_regression` computation performs a ridge regression on the merged datasets from multiple sites using specified covariates and dependent variables. This computation is designed to run within a federated learning environment, where each site performs a local regression analysis, and then global results are aggregated.

The key steps of the algorithm include:

1. **Local Ridge Regression (per site)**:
   - Each site runs ridge regression on its local data, standardizing the covariates and regressing against one or more dependent variables.
   - Statistical metrics (e.g., t-values, p-values, R-squared) are calculated using an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to provide interpretability.

2. **Global Aggregation (controller)**:
   - After each site computes its local regression results, the controller aggregates the results by performing a weighted averaging of the coefficients and other statistics based on the number of subjects (degrees of freedom) per site.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The computation reads covariate and dependent variable data from CSV files (`covariates.csv` and `data.csv` respectively).
   - Covariates are standardized using z-scores, and an intercept term is added.
   
2. **Ridge Regression**:
   - The computation fits a ridge regression model (with alpha = 1.0) to the standardized covariates and dependent variables.
   - The resulting coefficients are stored for each dependent variable.

3. **OLS Model for Statistical Metrics**:
   - To compute additional statistics (t-values, p-values, R-squared), an OLS model is fitted using the same covariates and dependent variables.
   - The computation extracts these metrics to provide more detailed insights beyond the ridge regression coefficients.

4. **Result Storage (per site)**:
   - Each site's regression results are saved locally in JSON format (`site_regression_result.json`), including:
     - Coefficients
     - t-Statistics
     - p-Values
     - R-Squared
     - Degrees of Freedom
     - Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)

5. **Global Aggregation**:
   - The controller aggregates the results from all sites. This involves:
     - Weighted averaging of the coefficients, t-statistics, p-values, and R-squared, using the number of subjects (derived from degrees of freedom) as weights.
     - Summing degrees of freedom and SSE across all sites to get global values.
   
6. **Global Results**:
   - The aggregated global results are saved as `global_regression_result.json` and include:
     - Weighted average coefficients
     - Weighted average t-Statistics
     - Weighted average p-values
     - Global R-squared
     - Total degrees of freedom
     - Global SSE

#### Data Format Specification

The computation requires two CSV files as input:

1. **Covariates File (`covariates.csv`)**
2. **Dependent Variables File (`data.csv`)**

Both files must follow a consistent format, though the specific covariates and dependents may vary from study to study based on the `parameters.json` file. The computation expects these files to match the covariate and dependent variable names specified in the `parameters.json` file.

##### Covariates File (`covariates.csv`)

- **Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Headers**: The file must include a header row where each column name corresponds to a covariate specified in the `parameters.json`.
- **Rows**: Each row represents a subject, where each column contains the value for a specific covariate.
- **Variable Names**: The names of the covariates in the header must match the entries in the `"Covariates"` section of the `parameters.json`.

**General Structure**:
```csv
<Covariate_1>,<Covariate_2>,...,<Covariate_N>
<value_1>,<value_2>,...,<value_N>
<value_1>,<value_2>,...,<value_N>
...
```

**Example (`covariates.csv`)**:
```csv
MDD,Age,Sex,ICV
0,35,0,1500000
1,42,1,1485000
0,29,0,1550000
1,56,1,1490000
```

##### Dependent Variables File (`data.csv`)

- **Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Headers**: The file must include a header row where each column name corresponds to a dependent variable specified in the `parameters.json`.
- **Rows**: Each row represents the same subject as in the `covariates.csv`, with values for the dependent variables.
- **Variable Names**: The names of the dependent variables in the header must match the entries in the `"Dependents"` section of the `parameters.json`.

**General Structure**:
```csv
<Dependent_1>,<Dependent_2>,...,<Dependent_N>
<value_1>,<value_2>,...,<value_N>
<value_1>,<value_2>,...,<value_N>
...
```

**Example (`data.csv`)**:
```csv
L_hippo,R_hippo,Tot_hippo
4500,4700,9200
4300,4600,8900
4400,4800,9200
4200,4500,8700
```
